# socialNet-workAPI

## Description

The project for the week was to create the backend of a social network API using NOSQL. We used MongoDB to store data inside of server. MongDB is a very flexible piece of technology and provides advantages over MySQL for databases that are continuously changing. In this application we can store users and their e-mails. Users can store thoughts and then other users can react to those thoughts. There is also a friend function within the application that allows to users to create a friendship between one another.
